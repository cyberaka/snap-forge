Read the attached image-adjuster.md specification.

Based on this, generate a complete TypeScript program using the Sharp library that:

- Loads a source image and a target image from file paths.

- Calculates the crop box for the source image based on the subject bounding box and the target image dimensions, following the expansion logic outlined.

- Adjusts the placement point dynamically for the target image based on the expanded crop.

- Crops the source image according to the calculated crop box.

- Places the cropped region onto the target image at the adjusted placement point.

- Saves the final composited target image as a new file.

- Logs the crop box and placement box to the console.

Follow these constraints:

- Do not scale or distort the subject (maintain its aspect ratio).

- Ensure the crop region stays within source image bounds.

- Ensure the placement box is adjusted correctly if the crop region is expanded beyond the original subject box.

The program should:

- Use TypeScript with Sharp for image manipulation.

- Include error handling for invalid crop/placement regions.

- Have clear function separation (e.g., calculate crop/placement, perform image manipulation).
